        <h1 class="page-title">Russell Westbrook's record-breaking triple-double was the most efficient in the history of NBA</h1>
        <img src="westbrook.jpg" />
        <p>Since Oscar Robertson’s historic 1961-62 season, no NBA player had averaged a triple double for an entire season.</p>
        <p>But with his record-setting 42nd triple-double last week (topping Robertson’s previous record of 41), Oklahoma City point guard Russell Westbrook ended a 55-year drought and officially stamped his name into the history books of the association. Westbrook finished the season averaging xx points, xx assists and xx rebounds per game to complete the triple-double average.</p>
        <p>These efforts have also placed him as one of the frontrunners for this year’s MVP race.</p>
        <p>But with so much celebration of Westbrook’s historic season, we wondered where his accomplishments, and in particular his triple doubles, stack up against the rest of the league throughout history.</p>
        <p>Instead of comparing the quantity of his triple doubles however, we chose to look into quality.</p>
        <p>To do this we had to solve for the NBA’s newest metric--efficiency.</p>
        <p>In solving for efficiency, we developed a formula based on Memphis Grizzlies general manager John Hollinger’s GameScore rating.</p>
